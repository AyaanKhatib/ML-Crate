Glove Embeddings
Glove is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.

GOAL
Implementtion of algorithm like tensorflow keras for classification.

DESCRIPTION

The main aim of the project is to make a model that helps to predict Glove Embedding on the given dataset.

WORK DONE

Balacing the dataset and defining keras Model with GRU units. Then tokenizing the comments from train dataset and predicting acuracy score of Model.

LIBRARIES NEEDED

Numpy Pandas tensorflow

CONCLUSION

We created a model which predict the . The model gives an accuracy score of the comments on the dataset.
